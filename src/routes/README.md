# Routes Folder

The "routes" folder in this project serves as the central place for defining and managing the routing logic. It is responsible for mapping URL paths to specific components/pages in the "components" folder, enabling navigation within the application.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this folder is to maintain a clear separation of concerns between routing logic and actual component code. By doing so, we achieve a modular and scalable project structure that improves maintainability and collaboration.

## File Structure

The routes folder contains directories for different sections or major pages of the application. Each directory should correspond to a unique URL path/route of the application.

For instance, if we have a website with sections like "Home," "About," "Products," and "Contact," the routes folder might look like this:

routes/
|-- home/
| |-- index.tsx
|
|-- about/
| |-- index.tsx
|
|-- products/
| |-- index.tsx
|
|-- contact/
| |-- index.tsx
|
|-- index.tsx

- Each section's directory contains an `index.tsx` file, which is used to import the corresponding component from the "components" folder and define the routing logic.

- The main `index.tsx` file inside the "routes" folder acts as the entry point for routing and may contain any global or fallback routing logic.

## Adding New Routes

When adding a new section or page to the application, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory inside the "routes" folder with an appropriate name that reflects the section or page.

2. Inside the new directory, create an `index.tsx` file and import the relevant component from the "components" folder.

3. Define the route path and any additional routing configuration using your frontend framework's routing system.

4. Update the main `index.tsx` file to include the new route or modify any global routing logic as needed.

## Framework Compatibility

This project's routing structure is designed to be compatible with our chosen frontend framework (e.g., React Router, Vue Router, etc.). Ensure that any changes or additions align with the framework's conventions.

## Contribution Guidelines

If you plan to make changes to the routing logic or project structure, please ensure that they align with the overall project architecture and conventions. Discuss major changes with the team before implementation.
