# Sections

The `sections` directory contains larger components that represent distinct sections or blocks of a page. These components encapsulate more complex sections of content and functionality.

Example sections:

- `HeroSection.js`: The hero section component that appears at the top of the homepage.
- `FeaturesSection.js`: A section showcasing the main features of the application.
- `ContactSection.js`: A section displaying contact information and a contact form.

Each section component is designed to be self-contained and reusable in various pages or layouts.
