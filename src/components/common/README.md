# Common

The `common` directory contains components that are used frequently throughout the application. These components are shared across multiple pages and sections and play a crucial role in maintaining consistency and reusability.

Example components:

- `Header.tsx`: The common header component that appears at the top of each page.
- `Footer.tsx`: The common footer component that appears at the bottom of each page.

Please ensure that components in this directory are kept generic and reusable across different parts of the application.
