# UI Components

The `ui` directory contains reusable UI components that are used across various pages and sections of the application. These components are smaller building blocks representing basic elements and controls.

Example UI components:

- `Button.tsx`: A reusable button component with different styles (e.g., primary, secondary, outline).
- `Input.tsx`: A reusable input component for text input fields.
- `Checkbox.tsx`: A component for handling checkbox input.

Feel free to add new UI components as needed and keep them modular and easy to use in different parts of the application.
