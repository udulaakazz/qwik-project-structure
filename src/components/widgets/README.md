# Widgets

The `widgets` directory contains components that are shared across multiple parts of the application, but they are smaller and more specialized than the components in the `common` directory.

Example widgets:

- `SocialMediaLinks.js`: A widget displaying social media links and icons.
- `NotificationBanner.js`: A widget for displaying non-intrusive notifications.

Widgets are designed to provide specific functionality that can be easily included in different parts of the application.
